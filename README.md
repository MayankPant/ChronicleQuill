# ChronicleQuill ðŸª¶  
A lightweight, real-time logging service for microservices, designed to handle high volumes efficiently with a sleek, user-friendly interface.

---

## Features  
- **Real-Time Logging**: View logs in real-time using WebSocket connections.  
- **Service Overview**: Get a summary of total logs and descriptions for each service.  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigate seamlessly to specific log viewers for granular monitoring.  
- **Efficient Architecture**: Logs are streamed directly from the backend without being stored in the frontend to manage large data volumes.  
- **Light & Dark Modes**: Switch between themes for a personalized experience.

---

## Technologies Used  
### Frontend  
- **React** (with **TypeScript**)  
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates  
- **Context API** for shared state management  

### Backend  
- **Django**  
- **Message Broker** with fanout exchange (e.g., RabbitMQ) for log distribution  
- **Queue-Based Processing** for scalable and decoupled log management
